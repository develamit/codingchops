Given an array with 8 elements { 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12}, arrange them along the sides of a 3X3 matrix such that the following conditions are satisfied 
Product of all 4 sides of the matrix is same. 
The sum of west side is 1 more than the sum of south side, 
the sum of south side is 2 more than the sum of east side and 
the sum of east side is 3 more than the sum of north side. 
The center element of the matrix will remain blank. Devise an algorithm to solve this programatically.
